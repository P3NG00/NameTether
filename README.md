# NameTether
Able to name entities from afar by tying renamed name tags to bows, crossbows, or even tridents!

Hold a renamed name tag in your offhand and fire a bow or crossbow to automatically 'tie' the name tag to the arrow.

CONFIG:

allow_any_item: (Default false)
Like the name says. If it's set to true, you can tie any item to the end of an arrow/trident. Even name tags that aren't named, they just won't name an entity if they hit one. The only exception is arrows of any type, due to having to hold them in your offhand to prioritize loading them into your bow/crossbow.

allow.bow: (Default true)
Allows tying name tags to arrows shot from bows.

allow.crossbow: (Default true)
Allows tying name tags to arrows shot from crossbows.

allow.trident: (Default false)
Allows tying name tags to thrown tridents.
